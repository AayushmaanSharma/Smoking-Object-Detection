The Smoking Object Detection project leverages deep learning to identify smoking-related objects such as cigarettes, lighters, and smoke in images or videos. It is designed for applications in public surveillance, workplace compliance monitoring, and automated enforcement of smoking regulations.

**Features**

Object Detection: Identifies cigarettes, lighters, and smoke in visual data.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a trained neural network for accurate detection.

Dataset Augmentation: Enhances training data to improve model performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessed using precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

Deployment Potential: Can be integrated into real-time surveillance or monitoring systems.

**Dataset**

The model is trained on a curated dataset containing labeled images of smoking-related objects. Data preprocessing includes:

Image annotation for precise object labeling.

Splitting into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

**Model and Training**

Uses a deep learning-based object detection framework YOLO V5.

Optimized using techniques like transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning.
